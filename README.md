##Notes
###BXA Files
BXA Files (\*.bxa) found in *Assets* folder are compiled Barlox Animation file. They can be loaded using BarlogxAnimator, which I wrote a few months ago. Source code of BXA file loader is in the CardboardBox project, please feel free to check it out. It also does a good job illustrating structure of the cut-down version BXA files. I do not intend to publish BXA file specs or BXA tool kit. 

BarloX Animator component included in CardboardBox is minimal and features may be missing.

###libWyvernzora
libWyvernzora is my personal tool kit library with just a bit of everything in it. I only included parts that I needed in the CardboardBox project.
